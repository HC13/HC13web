# L-train Closure Effects

### Team Members: Tammy Yang - Maspeth, Fariha Ansari - West Village, Jalen Gill - Gramercy Park

## Maspeth 
### Not much will change because many houses did not rely on the L train at all. Even though the most efficient route in the lower west side of Maspeth included the L train, the next best alternative route took only a few minutes longer. Therefore, housing costs and quality of life will not change significantly.

## West Village
### In terms of commute time from three addresses, it did not seem to increase with the closure of the L-train. Some routes were actually quicker than that of the L-train. Therefore, there won’t be a drastic increase in housing costs. 

## Gramercy Park 
### Housing should not be affected that much by the closing of the L-Train. There will be alternatives created in order to supplement commuters from Gramercy Park. Because of this, location of homes do not need to change, especially in such a wealthy neighborhood. 

# Additional Services Needed

## Maspeth
### More buses and subways for existing routes. 
### Recommended buses include but are not limited to: Q59, QM10, QM24, and B38. 
### Recommended train routes: M train and W train.

## West Village
### Station on 6 Avenue had multiple trains, therefore entries and exits weren’t definitively linked to the L-train.
### Commuters can make use of the 2, C, and 3 trains, as they provide a quick route.

## Gramercy Park
### Replacement buses can be an alternative.
### For service to 8th Avenue, there will be a M14 Select Bus Service.
### Other replacement bus routes are being developed for travelling to Brooklyn.
